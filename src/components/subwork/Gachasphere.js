        Voters/electors demand a change, without specifying or appealing to a
        specific political party. At the initiation of the demand flow, voters
        give equal chances to all, as generously as possible.

          Assuming what citizens wanted in the first place is an observable
          progress on an arbitrary cause/policy, or new ones to be given
          capacity, more than which party/parties delivering that is of their
          concern.

        In essence, they expose and clarify their intentions in single or
        multi-levels *, meaning one or two elections ahead of time, for any
        specific topic that they wish to see developments in a positive
        direction.
        <br></br> <br></br>
        This is, hereby, an expressed expectation, for the reflections to their
        opinionated perspective and worldview, and hence, an individual, change

        and beyond).

        As an example, an individualâ€™s expectation and demand for global trust

        thereby a token of intention is demanded, and in the second level,
        exposition of a future time decision is made, this time, binding for
        those parties elected upon those voters' support. They are sincerely
        expected to keep their promises, and observed in time, knowing that
        voters' future support is somewhat depending on their actions on those
        matters. */}
