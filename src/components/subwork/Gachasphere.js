        A voter/elector demands a change, without specifying or appealing to a
        specific political party. At the initiation of the demand flow, voter give equal chance to all, as generous as possible. 
        <br></br>        <br></br>

        Because what they wanted in the first place, is progress in an arbitrary cause/policy, or new ones to be given capacity. <br></br><br></br> They expose and clarify their intentions in
        single or multi levels, meaning one or two elections ahead of time, for any specific topic that they wish to see improved. <br></br>  <br></br>This is, hereby, a reflection of an opinionated perspective and worldview.
        <br></br><br></br>
        As an example, an individual demand, for global trust and peacemaking is
        illustrated below:
        {/* In the first exposition, inclusion of change,
        thereby a token of intention is demanded, and in the second level,
        exposition of a future time decision is made, this time, binding for
        those parties elected upon those voters' support. They are sincerely
        expected to keep their promises, and observed in time, knowing that
        voters' future support is somewhat depending on their actions on those
        matters. */}
